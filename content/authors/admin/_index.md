      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning.
      By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends
      driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected
      deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks;
      identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep
      learning to your own applications.

    summary: >
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between
      functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage
      complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing
      an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great
      day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that
      you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working
      with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

My name is Shuning Zhao I am a Ph.D. Candidate from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaolin Hu](http://www.xlhu.cn/). I am also a member of the [Tsinghua Statistical Artificial Intelligence & Learning (TSAIL)](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) Group. My research interests include the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in finance, insurance, speech, and audio processing. I am also the co-foudner of [Promptlaw](www.promptlaw.com.au), a legal AI startup aimed at making legal services more accessible and affordable with the power of AI.
Prior to my PhD, I had over 8 years of industrial experience in data science, actuarial, and managerial roles in multinational corporations across Australia and the surrounding regions.
