title: Why are Businesses Failing at Data Science and AI?
abstract: There is a disconnect between businessesâ€™ understanding of becoming AI
  and data driven and the reality. Businesses think data science is the one step
  solution to all data problems to become AI driven. However, in reality, it
  requires much more and a much bigger team of different expertise, not just
  data scientists, to truly harness the power of data and AI.
